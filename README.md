Notes:

  - I work on linux distributions where python works natively without
    any specific installation or configuration procedure. Windows and Mac
    users should have their python installations ready for the training.
  - We will be using python 3.3/3.4 for the training and discuss
differences
    in python 2.7, unless requested otherwise in advance.
  - Using an IDE is not part of the training unless a specific one is
    requested in advance. A basic text editor suitable for programming
    and a terminal window are all that you need.
  - Altering the course to fit your needs is possible and encouraged.
