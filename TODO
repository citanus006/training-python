Python should support:

  * additiona step argument - enumerate(something, start, step)
  * classproperty

Python 2.x doesn't seem to propagate exceptions from finally:

    try:
        stream = open("sadjflksajfdlka")
    finally:
        stream.close()

TODO: why socket doesn't work with print (print("...".encode("ascii"), file=sock)
